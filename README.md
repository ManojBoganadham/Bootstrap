## What is `Node.js` and NPM

Node.js helps to bring the power of JS to the desktop. It is based on JavaScript runtime 
engine built on the Chrome V8. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model which makes it very efficient to run JS 
programs on computer. Node.js operates on a single-thread event loop, using non-blocking I/O calls, allowing it to 
support tens of thousands of concurrent connections without incurring the cost of 
thread context switching.

NPM (Node Package Manager) manages all the Node modules and packages made availabel by users.
